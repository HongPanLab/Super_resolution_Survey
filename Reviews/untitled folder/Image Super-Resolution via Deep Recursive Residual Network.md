## Short introduction
This paper proposes a very deep CNN model (up to 52 con- volutional layers) named Deep Recursive Residual Network (DRRN) that strives for deep yet concise networks. Specifi- cally, residual learning is adopted, both in global and local manners, to mitigate the difficulty of training very deep net- works; recursive learning is used to control the model pa- rameters while increasing the depth.
